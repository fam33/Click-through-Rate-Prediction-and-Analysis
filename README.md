# Click-through-Rate-Prediction-and-Analysis

Click-through rate (CTR) signifies the proportion of users clicking on a particular link in relation to the total number of users who view a webpage, email, or advertisement. In the realm of advertising agencies, the ability to predict which users are more likely to engage with targeted ads holds significant importance. The success of online promotions relies on user reactions, and understanding user responses aids companies in selecting more relevant and effective advertisements. Daily browsing exposes us to numerous ads across various websites, prompting curiosity about the profitability of these ads and the criteria behind their recommendation to users. Consequently, I've developed a model to assess machine learning algorithms for accurately estimating click-through rates, recognizing the pivotal role CTR plays in evaluating ad performance. This emphasis on predicting ad clicks is crucial, as it helps advertising firms attract users who are more inclined to interact with the advertisements they encounter.
